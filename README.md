# Android assessment

The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam showcases one of the most famous paintings in the world: De Nachtwacht - or: The Night Watch in English - painted by Rembrandt van Rijn. To make their collection more accessible, the Rijksmuseum exposed their collection through an open API. 

For this assignment we ask you to create an Android application that lets the user search and retrieve data from the Rijksmuseum API.

## Project
The app should consist of the following parts:
- Search Screen
    - Consisting of a search bar and a list of results. The user should be able to make a query and get the art objects for that query.
- Art object detail page 
    - Consisting of the title, image, and 2 or more interesting fields of the art object.

**Tips**
- Not sure what to search for? Check out this [list of painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_painters_in_the_collection_of_the_Rijksmuseum) in the collection of the Rijksmuseum

**API Reference**
- [Documentation for the API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/). Everything you need to access the API should be on this page
- [How to get an API key](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/#access-to-apis)

## Guidelines
- This small app should give us a good idea of your coding skills.
- Use only Kotlin.
- Use Jetpack Compose for the UI.
- Pay attention to edge cases.
- The app should be resilient to network failures.
- Do not focus too much on styling the UI.
- Keep testability in mind.
- You can use 3rd party libraries and framework. However let us see some of your own coding as well.
